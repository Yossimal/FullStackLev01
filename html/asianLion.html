          <h2 class="title_logo">Habitat</h2>
          <img src="..\images\images-removebg-preview.png" class="title_logo">
        <p>The majestic Asiatic lion once roamed across the Middle East and Asia, 
          from Greece to Bangladesh, However, by the early 1900s the species had been hunted to the brink of extinction. 
          Today, an estimated 674 Asiatic lions exist in the wild, living in the Indian state of Gujarat, Western India.</p>

        <h2 class="title_logo">Conservation</h2>
        <img src="..\images\EN.png" class="title_logo">
        <p>Due to conservation initiatives, this small population is steadily increasing but the species is 
          listed as Endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), as it is still vulnerable 
          to many threats.Its limited distribution is a major cause for concern as a disease outbreak or a natural 
          disaster could have drastic consequences for the species.</p>

        <h2>Did You Know?</h2>
        <p>Lions are the only cats that live in groups, called prides. Prides are family units that
          may include up to three males, a dozen or so females, and their young. All of a pride’s
          lionesses are related and female cubs typically stay with the group as they age. Young males eventually 
          leave and may establish their own prides by taking over a group headed by another male.</p>
          
        <h2>Cultural Icons</h2>
        <p>Lions, including the Asian lion, have been important symbols in Asian, Middle Eastern and European
           cultures for tens of thousands of years. The earliest known depictions of lions are cave
           drawings from the famous Lascaux caves in France around 32,000 years ago. The 31.1cm Löwenmensch figurine,
           known as the Lion-man or the Lion-human – an ivory sculpture found in the Hohlenstein-Stadel
           cave in 1939 – was carved from a mammoth tusk around 39,000 years ago by the Aurignacian people.</p>
